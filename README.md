###Social Media Sentiment Analysis

##Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in text data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The focus is on understanding sentiment trends and evaluating performance across various machine learning models.

Structure of the Notebook
Data Loading:

The dataset is uploaded and loaded using Pandas.
Initial inspections include dataset information, null values, and a preview of the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations to understand the distribution of sentiments.
Analysis of sentiment proportions and platform-based sentiment distributions.
Engagement analysis based on metrics like retweets and likes.
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning and tokenization.
Feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer.
Model Building:

Logistic Regression and Transformer-based models (transformers library) for sentiment classification.
Dataset splitting using train_test_split.
Evaluation:

Visualizations and metrics to evaluate model performance.
Key Features
Visualization:

Bar charts for sentiment distribution.
Stacked bar charts for platform-based sentiment analysis.
Boxplots to show engagement metrics (likes and retweets) by sentiment.
Libraries Used:

Data manipulation: pandas, numpy.
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn.
Machine Learning: sklearn (Logistic Regression, scaling, train-test split).
NLP: TfidfVectorizer and Transformer models (transformers).
Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn transformers
You may also need Google Colab if you are using the Colab environment.

Usage Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Run the Notebook: Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and execute cells sequentially.

Input Data:

The notebook uses a CSV file named sentimentdataset.csv. Replace this with your own dataset if needed.
Outputs:

Visualizations of sentiment distribution and trends.
Engagement insights based on sentiment.
Model evaluation metrics for the sentiment classifier.
Example Visualizations
Sentiment Distribution:

A bar chart showing the counts and proportions of each sentiment.
Platform Sentiment Distribution:

A stacked bar chart highlighting sentiment trends across different platforms.
Engagement by Sentiment:

Boxplots of retweets and likes for each sentiment.
